Not only does the scanner implement verification before scanning but also it ensures automatic data encryption during processing and data deletion after scanning.\n\n&nbsp;\n<div>\n<ul class=\"list-a\">\n \t<li>Login authentication\nStrictly controls what people can do with the scanner.</li>\n \t<li>Encryption\nScanned data is encrypted and temporarily stored in the scanner while it is being processed for e-mail, faxing, printing or storage.</li>\n \t<li>Data transmission security\nIt supports strong security protocols : LDAPS, HTTPS and FTPS</li>\n \t<li>Scanned data deletion\nautomatically deletes the temporarily stored data from internal memory after scanned data has been emailed, faxed, printed out and saved to a network folder.</li>\n \t<li>Secure initialization\nWhen N7100E is initialized, free regions of the internal memory can be overwritten with completely random and meaningless data. A new cipher key is generated after user information is deleted. All of these ensure that no trace of old user data can be retrieved from open memory.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3 class=\"hdg-b\">Perfect Fit Customized to Your Unique Needs</h3>\nAdministrators can customize the job menu on the screen and scan settings to suit the work of a specific user or user group registered to the scanner.\n<h3></h3>\n<h3>Customized one touch operation</h3>\nUsers can customize \"job button\" on the job menu. They can simply login to the scanner and select a job from their personalized job menus on the N7100E's touch screen. Customized job menu ensures efficient and it can be possible for each user to secure decentralized data entry.\n\n&nbsp;\n<ul class=\"list-none flex-col3s\">\n \t<li><img src=\"https://www.pfu.ricoh.com/global/scanners/images/v5/features-image1_tcm100-4730191_tcm100-2750236-32.png\" /></li>\n \t<li><img src=\"https://www.pfu.ricoh.com/global/scanners/images/v5/features-image2_tcm100-4730192_tcm100-2750236-32.png\" /></li>\n \t<li><img src=\"https://www.pfu.ricoh.com/global/scanners/images/v5/features-image3_tcm100-4730193_tcm100-2750236-32.png\" /></li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n<h3>Personalized applications with SDK</h3>\nUser’s application can be integrated to the scanner as add-in software using the Network Scanner Control SDK (for Windows®). Added applications are displayed on the job menu.\n<h3></h3>\n<h3>USB Port for optional USB equipment</h3>\nThe scanner supports USB port, so that hardware keyboard, mouse, and other USB equipment such as contactless IC card reader can be connected for various purposes such as personal identification. The unit can function as a flexible terminal for any work environment\n\n* Only keyboard/mouse are supported.\n<div>\n\nWhen using with other USB devices such as IC card reader, development of Add-in application using Network Scanner Control SDK (free download) is necessary.\n\n* Additional development of the built-in add-in application for the N7100 32-bit driver is required to use the application with the N7100E.\n\n* To satisfy the security policy, anti-virus software can be installed as an option to safely expand the functions.\n\n</div>\n&nbsp;\n\n<img src=\"https://www.pfu.ricoh.com/global/scanners/images/v5/features-image4_tcm100-4730195_tcm100-2750236-32.png\" />\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3 class=\"hdg-b\">Advanced software for work efficiency</h3>\n<h3>Monitor scanner operation with Scanner Central Admin</h3>\nScanner Central Admin* specializes in centralized management of multiple scanners, including batch updates of scanner settings and firmware, as well as monitoring of errors and consumables status. The software is also capable of managing up to 1,000 scanners per server.\n\n*To use Scanner Central Admin on Windows, you need to purchase a CAL (Client Access License).

    "description": "The redesigned WideTEK 44 wide format CCD scanner with it‘s large color touchscreen scans documents up to 44 inches wide (1120 mm) astonishingly fast. Bright white LED illumination ensures long lifetime and best scan results.\n<h3 class=\"item-title\">Gentle Scanning of Historical and Fragile Documents</h3>\nWideTEK 44 gently scans due to special transport rollers that serve as pressure points ensuring safe document transport. For historical and fragile documents, this is critical.\n\nThe new background drum does not touch the glass plate at any time, avoiding scratches and document skews. For extra contrast on sepias and film based documents, the standard black background drum can be easily exchanged with a white drum, with no tools required.\n\nAutomatic document size recognition means that operators are flexible when feeding a source document into the scanner. It is not necessary to exactly center the document on the scan area. With crop and deskew, the resulting image output will be straight, centered and without black borders.\n\nState of the art illumination using bright white LEDs guarantees long lifetime and a low cost of ownership, since there are practically no consumables necessary over the life of the product. Cutting edge camera technology, with a dust-protected, fully sealed camera box holding CCD systems that use a patented stitching procedure, delivers a scanner resolution of up to 1200 dpi optical.\n\nThe user operates the scanner either with a standard internet browser or alternatively, via the built-in touchscreen. A monitor directly connected to the scanner can be used for image control or to modify the scan parameters, without a client PC. Using the touchscreen display, up to 30 different password protected jobs can be defined and stored. The jobs contain pre-configured settings such as scan parameters or directories on the network drives.\n<h3 class=\"item-title\">Easy to use walk up scanning or mobile scanning with Scan2PAD<sup>®</sup></h3>\nScan2Pad lets you control the WideTEK 44 using an iPad or an Android tablet or even a smartphone running Android version 4.0.3 or higher.\n\nThe exceptionally high scanning speed, dust-protected and encapsulated optical components and the absence of consumables characterize this highly efficient production-ready device. With a life expectancy of over one million scans, the WideTEK 44 redefines the price/performance ratio in the wide format scanner market.\n\nOptimize your investments by purchasing the WideTEK 44 wide format CCD scanner and upgrading to the larger WideTEK 48 format later, when necessary.\n<div id=\"WideTEK-44-Functions-Features\" class=\"content-holder scrollSpy\">\n<h2 class=\"main-title\">WideTEK<sup>®</sup> 44 Functions and Features</h2>\nFunctions, features and options available on the WideTEK 44 wide format CCD scanner.\n<h3 class=\"item-title\">WideTEK<sup>®</sup> 44 Functions</h3>\n<ul class=\"list-disc\">\n \t<li>Scans up to 44 inches (1120 mm) in width</li>\n \t<li>Fastest color scanning at 12 inches per second (18.4 m/min)</li>\n \t<li>1200 x 1200 dpi scanner resolution</li>\n \t<li>Automatic crop &amp; deskew</li>\n \t<li>On the fly rotation while scanning facilitates postprocessing</li>\n \t<li>Face up scanning (no more \"blind\"scanning)</li>\n \t<li>Real time display of scanned images, modify images without rescanning</li>\n \t<li>Standalone device with its own integrated PC</li>\n \t<li>Scan2USB – Walk up Scanning to any USB device</li>\n \t<li>Scan2Print – Output to any connected printer or hot folder</li>\n \t<li>Output formats: PDF, PDF/A, JPEG, TIFF, PNM, Multipage PDF</li>\n \t<li>Scan2Network – Output to any network drive</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 class=\"item-title\">WideTEK<sup>®</sup> 44 Features</h3>\n<ul class=\"list-disc\">\n \t<li>Dual LED lamps with natural light diffusor, no warm up, IR/UV free</li>\n \t<li>Large WVGA color touchscreen for simplified operation</li>\n \t<li>User interface configurable in your language</li>\n \t<li>Virus resistant Linux OS</li>\n \t<li>OS independent, runs with Windows 7, 8, 10, Linux, Mac</li>\n \t<li>ScanWizard uses any browser: IE, Safari, Chrome, Firefox</li>\n \t<li>Integrated walk up scanning software</li>\n \t<li>Remote maintenance and troubleshooting</li>\n \t<li>Firmware updates via web interface</li>\n \t<li>Dust-free camera technology</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 class=\"item-title\">WideTEK<sup>®</sup> 44 Options</h3>\n<ul class=\"list-disc\">\n \t<li>Foot Switch – Hardware option for batch scanning</li>\n \t<li>WideTEK – UMFS universal multifunction stand, external 19\" monitor for virtual rescans</li>\n \t<li>Batch Scan Wizard – Software option for batch scanning</li>\n \t<li>Scan2iPF – Software option for direct and fast copy to imagePROGRAF</li>\n \t<li>Scan2EDIT – Software option for scanning and image processing in a single step</li>\n \t<li>Scan2ICC – Subscription for ICC color management and profiles</li>\n \t<li>Full Coverage Warranty – Up to 5 years subscription for full coverage warranty package and free spare parts</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<hr />\n\n<div id=\"WideTEK-44-Markets-Applications\" class=\"content-holder scrollSpy\">\n<h2 class=\"main-title\">WideTEK<sup>®</sup> 44 Markets &amp; Applications</h2>\nThe WideTEK 44 wide format CCD scanner is a valuable production device for the following markets and applications.

    "description": "The robotic book scanner ROBO SCAN V2 is the most versatile robotic book scanner in the market. It offers the advantages of a robot combined with the convenience of a manual book scanner. The ROBO SCAN V2 was designed for realistic digitization projects where the robotic part can do most of the job but the same scanner is also able to handle problematic books in manual mode.\n\nThe robotic book scanner ROBO SCAN V2 is a unique product which offers robotic and manual scanning in the same unit. Moreover originals can be scanned in different orientations. For best results the use of a glass plate is recommended. The whole procedure of turning the pages, moving the v-shaped glass plate up and down and releasing the scan is a fully automated process.\n\nScanning books without exposing them to any pressure or simply contact-free is also possible. The v-shaped glass can be removed within less than one minute.\n\nThe ROBO SCAN V2 also allows you to scan manually. If there is a problematic book that the robotic arm can‘t handle, the robotic function can be disabled and the pages can be turned manually.\n\nIn fact the ROBO SCAN V2 offers even more! It is also possible to change the book cradle from v-shape to flat in order to scan magazines, photographs, maps or any other single sheet originals.\n\nThe ROBO SCAN V2 can be operated via touch panel or optionally with Batch Scan Wizard which is a fast and easy to use software solution for professional management of large scanning volumes and jobs. The software increases data throughput and reduces operational tasks substantially. Batch Scan Wizard is ideal for processing large volume scanning jobs but is just as useful for smaller volumes in which more advanced operations like page splitting or extracting specific areas on a document is required.",

Its size and mobility makes it ideal for most applications. VERSASCAN 3650 is a household name in archives, libraries and the private industry around the world. It features very high optical resolution and high productivity at the same time. The VERSASCAN 3650 A0 flatbed scanner comes with V3D – a new scanning technology which allows users to scan many different types of originals. It offers the capability of digitizing structured surfaces such as wood, rubber, plastic, fabrics, carpet and many more types of material. Finally, light reflecting items such as coins, seals and metal prints can be captured at the highest quality. The V3D technolgy presents new opportunities as it can be applied to materials outside the normal archive and library world. V3D stands for VISUAL 3D. It is a newly designed scanning technology that produces results that look like 3D. The process is based on different lighting scenarios where the same area is being captured with several different lighting angles on the fly. The software then combines the separate images into one image. As a result V3D images offer perfect reproductions of nearly any structured surface. In additon it increases the depth of field significantly. This approach is unique and raises the outstanding image quality of SMA scanners to another level. The V3D function can be disabled and regular 2D scanning can be performed.\n\nOperating the VERSASCAN 3650 A0 flatbed scanner is as easy as operating a photo copier. Open the lid, place the document, close the lid and hit the scan button – that’s it! Alternatively the scanner can conveniently be operated via foot switch.\n\nSMA is the only company in the world that offers a full line of large format flatbed scanners varying from A1+ to double A0+ as well as a line of manual and robotic book scanners. All flatbed scanners are suitable for scanning large and fragile originals that do not require a book cradle or cannot be handled by a feeder. Due to its newly designed roll-away mount it is easy to move the scanners around – regardless of their size. Simply unlock the flatbed scanner, fold it up and off you go. Alternatively a motorized height adjustment is available in order to accomodate different working positions.",

    "description": "<h1>Double A0 Flatbed Scanner VERSASCAN 36100</h1>\n<h3>A true XXL Flatbed Scanner!</h3>\nThe VERSASCAN 36100 is a unique double A0 flatbed scanner with an enormous scanning length of 2540 mm. It is ideal for scanning very long oversize originals. Renowned users around the world utilize the VERSASCAN 36100 to fulfill their special needs. VERSASCAN is a household name in archives, libraries and the private industry around the world. It features very high optical resolution and high productivity at the same time. The VERSASCAN 36100 double A0 flatbed scanner comes with V3D – a new scanning technology which allows users to scan many different types of originals. It offers the capability of digitizing structured surfaces such as wood, rubber, plastic, fabrics, carpet and many more types of material. Finally, light reflecting items such as coins, seals and metal prints can be captured at the highest quality. The V3D technolgy presents new opportunities as it can be applied to materials outside the normal archive and library world. V3D stands for VISUAL 3D. It is a newly designed scanning technology that produces results that look like 3D. The process is based on different lighting scenarios where the same area is being captured with several different lighting angles on the fly. The software then combines the separate images into one image. As a result V3D images offer perfect reproductions of nearly any structured surface. In additon it increases the depth of field significantly. This approach is unique and raises the outstanding image quality of SMA scanners to another level. The V3D function can be disabled and regular 2D scanning can be performed.\n\nOperating the VERSASCAN 36100 double A0 flatbed scanner is as easy as operating a photo copier. Open the lid, place the document, close the lid and hit the scan button – that’s it! Alternatively the scanner can conveniently be operated via foot switch.\n\nSMA is the only company in the world that offers a full line of large format flatbed scanners varying from A1+ to double A0+ as well as a line of manual and robotic book scanners. All flatbed scanners are suitable for scanning large and fragile originals that do not require a book cradle or cannot be handled by a feeder. Due to its newly designed roll-away mount it is easy to move the scanners around – regardless of their size. Simply unlock the flatbed scanner, fold it up and off you go. Alternatively a motorized height adjustment is available in order to accommodate different working positions.",

    "description": "The SCAN MASTER 0 3650 A0 book scanner is our flagship model. We refer to it as the Jack of all Trades as it is the most versatile A0 book scanner in the market. With its unique tripartite book cradle the SCAN MASTER 0 3650 can be used as Al book scanner, A0 book scanner and A0 flatbed scanner. With a motorized standard book cradle of 35 cm range it can handle really big stuff. If this is not enough a motorized 50 cm book cradle is optional available. Operating the SMA SCAN MASTER 0 3650 A0 book scanner is easy and convenient. Simply place the book and hit the scan button. The rest of the process is fully automatic. All the operator has to do is to flip the page and release the scan. All SMA scanners are equipped with a special LED light illuminator that does not produce any ultraviolet or infrared radiation. Harmless and uniform illumination is guaranteed. The illuminator of all SMA scanners is located inside the scan head and is simply moved across the original. As a result all SMA book scanners can be operated independent from ambient light and do not irritate the operator‘s eyes.\n\nThe SCAN MASTER 0 3650 A0 book scanner comes with V3D Technology – a new scanning technology which allows users to scan many different types of originals. It offers the capability of digitizing structured surfaces such as wood, rubber, plastic, fabrics, carpet and many more types of material. Finally, light reflecting items such as coins, seals, metal prints and silver or Gold coated originals can be captured at the highest quality. The V3D technology presents new opportunities as it can be applied to materials outside the normal archive and library world. V3D stands for VISUAL 3D. It is a newly designed scanning technology that produces results that look like 3D. The process is based on different lighting scenarios where the same area is being captured with several different lighting scenarios on the fly. The software then combines the separate images into one image. As a result V3D images offer perfect reproductions of nearly any structured surface. In addition it increases the depth of field significantly. This approach is unique and raises the outstanding image quality of SMA scanners to another level. The V3D function can be disabled and regular 2D scanning can be performed.",

Interruptions arising from paper misfeeds at high speed scans of 90 ppm, can be avoided.\n\n<img src=\"https://www.pfu.ricoh.com/global/scanners/images/v5/img_fi-8290_features01_tcm100-6440534_tcm100-2750236-32.jpg\" />\n<h3>Evolved paper protection function combines sound and image technologies</h3>\nIn addition to iSOP<sup>*</sup> Technology that halts scanning heavily-skewed and stapled documents at abnormal noise detection, the \"Image Monitoring\" technology acts as a paper protection.\nA technology that performs real-time image monitoring to keep document safe when angles exceed the safe range to assist users with accurate and comfortable scanning.\n\n*Intelligent Sonic Paper Protection.\n<h3>Supports scanning of wide range of documents</h3>\nThe scanner handles various types of documents to enable all scans with a single scanner. The Manual Feed Mode enables reading of copy forms, glued-on documents and bi-folded A3 documents. Passports and booklets up to thicknesses of 7 mm can be read as well, without carrier sheets.\n\nSince the scanner identifies the presence of thick plastic cards and labelled or barcoded documents, it excludes multi-feed errors, making simultaneous scanning of cards and paper document possible even when multi-feed detection is ON. Users are able to set documents together and continue scanning without interruption.\n<h3></h3>\n<h3 class=\"hdg-b\">Optimized high-quality image data for business use</h3>\n<h3>PFU Clear Image Capture</h3>\nThe scanner incorporates the strong characteristics of both CIS and CCD to generate optimal images for OCR.\nCombining the new CIS sensor with the GI image processing engine suppresses the occurrence of color shifts.\n\"PFU Clear Image Capture\" produces high definition images for data extraction while keeping power consumption to the minimum and reduces startup times.\n\n<img src=\"https://www.pfu.ricoh.com/global/scanners/images/v5/img_fi-8290_features02_tcm100-6440535_tcm100-2750236-32.jpg\" />\n<h3>Avoid image loss with Overscan Control function</h3>\nThree sensors accurately detect tips of documents and extend scanning area automatically, ensuring that sufficient margins are secured around the scanned documents. An accurate image data can be generated without defects even when original documents are skewed. Users can save the time to re-scan documents.\n\n<img src=\"https://www.pfu.ricoh.com/global/scanners/images/v5/img_fi-8290_features03_tcm100-6440536_tcm100-2750236-32.jpg\" />\n<h3></h3>\n<h3 class=\"hdg-b\">Increased usability and flexibility to scan in any environment</h3>\n<h3>Stress-free operation with the Color LCD display</h3>\nEquipped with a color LCD panel, users can view status information and select setting configuration more easily. Use of color enables intuitive operation, for reduced human errors.\n\n<img src=\"https://www.pfu.ricoh.com/global/scanners/images/v5/img_fi-8290_features04_tcm100-6440537_tcm100-2750236-32.jpg\" />\n<h3>Keep documents in order with the Stacker Supporter</h3>\nThe Stacker Supporter keeps documents in order, even when scanning mixed batches containing small pieces of paper that tend to fly out of the document tray. Scanned documents are easy to retrieve, reducing time spent on post-scan organization.\n<h3>Scan various documents with a single scanner</h3>\nEquipped with a built-in flatbed, this scanner can scan fragile documents and thick books, impossible to scan with ADF.\n<h3>Supports various operation modes according to the customer’s environment</h3>\nThe scanner supports both USB and LAN connectivity so that it can be used not only near the computer but also in various places under the network environment.\nBy using server software \"PaperStream NX Manager\"<sup>*1</sup>, it is possible to scan in environments without the PC or even from a Web application running on a thin client terminal.\n\n*1 A Windows Client Access License (CAL) is required for each scanner device or user.\n<h3 class=\"hdg-b\">Advanced software improves workflow before and after scanning</h3>\nThe functions of PaperStream IP and PaperStream Capture, scanner driver and capture software for fi Series respectively, improves operators’ overall productivity, by reducing the number of operations before and after scanning.\n<h3>PaperStream Series software is easier to use with expanded functions</h3>\nWith \"Setting Assistant\" on PaperStream Capture, frequent manual operations like deleting blank pages or correcting page orientations, can be reduced by following the suggestions that pop up in the software notifications.\nOptions are available for added flexibility.\n- For the customers requiring advanced workflow, PaperStream Capture Pro, at a fee.\n- For customers with simple and basic operation needs, PaperStream ClickScan.\n<h3>Quick MRZ Recognition</h3>\nFor passport and ID card scanning, personal information such as full name, document number, nationality, contained in the MRZ<sup>*</sup> (Machine Readable Zone), can be extracted for efficient entry of customer information.\n\n*Supports recognition of MRZ on passports and ID cards, as defined by the ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organization). Passport MRZ layout is defined as two rows of 44 characters each (Doc 9303 TD3 format). ID card MRZ layout defined as three rows of 30 characters (TD1 format) or as two rows of 36 characters (TD2 format).\n\n<img src=\"https://www.pfu.ricoh.com/global/scanners/images/v5/img_fi-8290_features06_tcm100-6440538_tcm100-2750236-32.jpg\" />",

    "description": "<h3>Support form document up to 242 x 356 mm (9.5 x 14 in.)</h3>\nThe AD230U boasts a unique and innovative design in comparison with its predecessors – the ability to accommodate form document up to 242 x 356 mm (9.5 x 14 in.). The extended document width from standard 216 mm (8.5 in.) to 242 mm (9.5 in.) makes the AD230U more competitive to fit for a wider range of documents.\n<h3>A Duplex Scanner Suited for Document and Cards</h3>\nThanks to the advanced straight paper path and image processing technology, mixed batches of documents with varies sizes and weights can be scanned, appropriately cropped, deskewed, and ready to use. Scan size accepts paper from receipts (50 x 50 mm/2” x 2”) to business document (242 x 356 mm/9.5 x 14 in.). The auto document feeder is also robust enough to feed paper up to 413 g/m2 (110 lb.) and embossed hard cards such as ID cards, credit cards, driver’s license, and health insurance card up to 1.25 mm in thickness.\n<h3>Reverse Roller Enhances Feeding Reliability</h3>\nDesigned with the innovative reverse roller for advanced paper separation capability, the AD230U delivers outstanding feeding reliability and operating productivity by effectively reducing the risk of a multi-feed or paper jam.\n<h3>Paper Protection Technology</h3>\nThe advanced Paper protection technology protects valuable paper from being wrinkled or torn by halting the scan process once a skewed page is detected.\n<h3>Ultrasonic Multi-Feed Detection</h3>\nWith the ultrasonic multi-feed detection capability, the scanner allows you to set overlapped paper by detecting paper thickness between documents. The ultrasonic function can be turned off when scanning document with labels, sticky notes, or taped receipts. This innovative design prevents double feeding and effectively scans documents of different weights or thickness.\n<h3>Compact Design to Save Your Space</h3>\nThe AD230U features a unique and stylish design as both the input and output paper tray can be folded when not in use. The paper tray also helps to protect the unit from dust. Unlike bulky conventional scanners, the slim AD230U can be easily carried and fit on a desk without taking up a lot of space.\n<h3>Intuitive Button Scanning</h3>\nThe AD230U is easy to use through the LCD display and buttons on the panel. By selecting your destination and pressing the “Scan” button, the scan can be done and the scanned image can be sent to your specified destination application such as e-mail, printer, or your favorable image-editing software application. Up to nine frequently used scan settings and destinations can be preset for different scanning needs.▍Powerful Bundled Software Applications\n\nThe AD230U come with TWAIN and ISIS drivers, and are bundled with a suite of powerful software applications that include Avision Button Manager, AvScan , and PaperPort . With Button Manager, you can create searchable PDFs, scan and send images to e-mail, printer, or clouds servers such as Google DriveTM, FaceBook, or Evernote® with just a simple press of a button. The AVScan and PaperPort are highly effective image processing and document management software that helps you streamline your task more efficiently.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3>Features</h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Fast, 40 ppm / 80 ipm scanning in color, grayscale and monochrome (200 dpi, A4)</li>\n \t<li>Support form paper up to 242 x 356 mm (9.5 x 14 in.)</li>\n \t<li>Daily duty cycle up to 6,000 sheets</li>\n \t<li>Robust 100 page automatic document feeder (A4 : 80 g/m2, 20 lb.)</li>\n \t<li>Auto crop and deskew a document with the advanced image processing unit to enhance the scanning speed</li>\n \t<li>Reverse roller technology delivers outstanding feeding reliability</li>\n \t<li>Hard and embossed card scanning up to 1.25 mm in thickness in portrait or landscape feeding</li>\n \t<li>Press and scan to cloud servers via the bundled software Button Manager V2</li>\n \t<li>Earth-friendly LED technology</li>\n \t<li>Long page scanning:  3000 mm (118”)</li>\n \t<li>Auto power off setting</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;",

    "description": "<h3>Support form document up to 242 x 356 mm (9.5 x 14 in.)</h3>\nThe AD240U boasts a unique and innovative design in comparison with its predecessors – the ability to accommodate form document up to 242 x 356 mm(9.5 x 14 in.). The extended document width from standard 216 mm (8.5 in.) to 242 mm (9.5 in.) makes the AD240U more competitive to fit for a wider range of documents.\n<h3>A Simplex Scanner Suited for Document and Cards</h3>\nThanks to the advanced straight paper path and image processing technology, mixed batches of documents with varies sizes and weights can be scanned, appropriately cropped, deskewed, and ready to use. Scan size accepts paper from receipts ( 50 x 50 mm/2” x 2” ) to business document ( 242 x 256 mm/9.5” x 14” ). The auto document feeder is also robust enough to feed paper up to 413 g/m2 (110 lb.) and embossed hard cards such as ID cards, credit cards, driver’s license, and health insurance card up to 1.25 mm in thickness.\n<h3>Reverse Roller Enhances Feeding Reliability</h3>\nDesigned with the innovative reverse roller for advanced paper separation capability, the AD240U delivers outstanding feeding reliability and operating productivity by effectively reducing the risk of a multi-feed or paper jam.\n<h3>Paper Protection Technology</h3>\nThe advanced Paper protection technology protects valuable paper from being wrinkled or torn by halting the scan process once a skewed page is detected.\n<h3>Ultrasonic Multi-Feed Detection</h3>\nWith the ultrasonic multi-feed detection capability, the scanner allows you to set overlapped paper by detecting paper thickness between documents. The ultrasonic function can be turned off when scanning document with labels, sticky notes, or taped receipts. This innovative design prevents double feeding and effectively scans documents of different weights or thickness.\n<h3>Compact Design to Save Your Space</h3>\nThe AD240U features a unique and stylish design as both the input and output paper tray can be folded when not in use. The paper tray also helps to protect the unit from dust. Unlike bulky conventional scanners, the slim AD240U can be easily carried and fit on a desk without taking up a lot of space.\n<h3>High-Volume Daily Duty Cycle</h3>\nThe scanner can be used to scan up to 7,000 pages per day through the 100 page automatic document feeder. The data indicates that this scanner is designed to scan document in any application requiring frequent document and hard card scanning.\n<h3>Intuitive Button Scanning</h3>\nThe AD240U is easy to use through the LCD display and buttons on the panel. By selecting your destination and pressing the “Scan” button, the scan can be done and the scanned image can be sent to your specified destination application such as e-mail, printer, or your favorable image-editing software application. Up to nine frequently used scan settings and destinations can be preset for different scanning needs.\n<h3>Scan to Clouds Directly via Button Manager V2</h3>\nThe AD240U come with TWAIN and ISIS drivers, and are bundled with a suite of powerful software applications that include Avision Button Manager, AvScan, and PaperPort. With Button Manager, you can create searchable PDFs, scan and send images to e-mail, printer, or clouds servers such as Google DriveTM, FaceBook, or Evernote® with just a simple press of a button. The AVScan  and PaperPort are highly effective image processing and document management software that helps you streamline your task more efficiently.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3>Features</h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Fast, 40 ppm scanning in color, grayscale and monochrome (300 dpi, color)</li>\n \t<li>Max. document width up to 242 mm (9.5 in.)</li>\n \t<li>Daily duty cycle up to 7,000 sheets</li>\n \t<li>Robust 100 page automatic document feeder ( A4, 80 g/m2, 20 lb. )</li>\n \t<li>Auto crop and deskew a document with the advanced image processing unit</li>\n \t<li>to enhance the scanning speed</li>\n \t<li>Reverse roller technology delivers outstanding feeding reliability</li>\n \t<li>Hard and embossed card scanning up to 1.25 mm in thickness in portrait or landscape feeding</li>\n \t<li>Press and scan to cloud servers via the bundled software Button Manager V2</li>\n \t<li>Earth-friendly LED technology</li>\n \t<li>Long page scanning : 3000 mm ( 118” ) ( 300 dpi )</li>\n \t<li>Auto power off setting</li>\n</ul>",

    "description": "<h3>Color, and Graphical LCD Display</h3>\nThe AD345G series are easy to use through the LCD display and buttons on the panel. By selecting your destination and pressing the “Scan” button, the scan can be done and the scanned image can be sent to your specified destination application such as e-mail, printer, or your favorable image-editing software application. Up to nine frequently used scan settings and destinations can be preset for different scanning needs.\n<h3>A Duplex Scanner Suited for Document and Cards</h3>\nThanks to the advanced straight paper path and image processing technology, mixed batches of documents with varies sizes and weights can be scanned, appropriately cropped, deskewed, and ready to use. Scan size accepts paper from receipts (2” x 2”) to business document (8.5 x 14 in.). The auto document feeder is also robust enough to feed paper up to 413 g/m2 (110 lbs) and embossed hard cards such as ID cards, credit cards, driver’s license, and health insurance card up to 1.25mm in thickness.\n<h3>Reverse Roller Enhances Feeding Reliability</h3>\nDesigned with the innovative reverse roller for advanced paper separation capability, the AD345G series delivers outstanding feeding reliability and operating productivity by effectively reducing the risk of a multi-feed or paper jam.\n<h3>Ultrasonic Multi-Feed Detection</h3>\nWith the ultrasonic multi-feed detection capability, the scanner allows you to set overlapped paper by detecting paper thickness between documents. The ultrasonic function can be turned off when scanning document with labels, sticky notes, or taped receipts. This innovative design prevents double feeding and effectively scans documents of different weights or thickness.\n<h3>Compact Design to Save Your Space</h3>\nThe AD345G series features a unique and stylish design as both the input and output paper tray can be folded when not in use. The paper tray also helps to protect the unit from dust. Unlike bulky conventional scanners, the slim AD345G series can be easily carried and fit on a desk without taking up a lot of space.\n<h3>Powerful Bundled Software Applications</h3>\nThe AD345G series come with TWAIN and ISIS drivers, and are bundled with a suite of powerful software applications that include Avision Button Manager, AVScan , and PaperPort . With Button Manager, you can create searchable PDFs, scan and send images to e-mail, printer, or clouds servers such as Google DriveTM, or Evernote® with just a simple press of a button. The AVScan and PaperPort are highly effective image processing and document management software that helps you streamline your task more efficiently.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3>Features</h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Fast, 60ppm/120ipm scanning in color, grayscale and monochrome (200 dpi)</li>\n \t<li>Fast, 45ppm/90ipm scanning in color (300 dpi)</li>\n \t<li>Auto crop and deskew a document with the advanced Avision-developed image processing unit to enhance the scanning speed</li>\n \t<li>Support form paper up to 8.5 x 14 in.</li>\n \t<li>Daily duty cycle up to 10,000 sheets</li>\n \t<li>Robust 100-page automatic document feeder (80 g/m2, 20 lb)</li>\n \t<li>Reverse roller technology delivers outstanding feeding reliability</li>\n \t<li>Hard and embossed card scanning up to 1.25 mm in thickness in portrait or landscape feeding</li>\n \t<li>Press and scan to cloud servers via the bundled software Button Manager V2</li>\n \t<li>Earth-friendly LED technology</li>\n \t<li>Long page scanning:  1500 mm (59”) (600 dpi,color) / 5540 mm (218”) (200 dpi,color)</li>\n \t<li>hardware JPEG Compression, Compression TIFF (JPEG(7), CCITT G4, LZW), Compression PDF</li>\n \t<li>Auto power off setting</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;",

    "description": "<h3>Color, and Graphical LCD Display</h3>\nThe AD345G series are easy to use through the LCD display and buttons on the panel. By selecting your destination and pressing the “Scan” button, the scan can be done and the scanned image can be sent to your specified destination application such as e-mail, printer, or your favorable image-editing software application. Up to nine frequently used scan settings and destinations can be preset for different scanning needs.\n<h3>A Duplex Scanner Suited for Document and Cards</h3>\nThanks to the advanced straight paper path and image processing technology, mixed batches of documents with varies sizes and weights can be scanned, appropriately cropped, deskewed, and ready to use. Scan size accepts paper from receipts (2” x 2”) to business document (8.5 x 14 in.). The auto document feeder is also robust enough to feed paper up to 413 g/m2 (110 lbs) and embossed hard cards such as ID cards, credit cards, driver’s license, and health insurance card up to 1.25mm in thickness.\n<h3>Reverse Roller Enhances Feeding Reliability</h3>\nDesigned with the innovative reverse roller for advanced paper separation capability, the AD345G series delivers outstanding feeding reliability and operating productivity by effectively reducing the risk of a multi-feed or paper jam.\n<h3>Ultrasonic Multi-Feed Detection</h3>\nWith the ultrasonic multi-feed detection capability, the scanner allows you to set overlapped paper by detecting paper thickness between documents. The ultrasonic function can be turned off when scanning document with labels, sticky notes, or taped receipts. This innovative design prevents double feeding and effectively scans documents of different weights or thickness.\n<h3>Compact Design to Save Your Space</h3>\nThe AD345G series features a unique and stylish design as both the input and output paper tray can be folded when not in use. The paper tray also helps to protect the unit from dust. Unlike bulky conventional scanners, the slim AD345G series can be easily carried and fit on a desk without taking up a lot of space.\n<h3>Powerful Bundled Software Applications</h3>\nThe AD345G series come with TWAIN and ISIS drivers, and are bundled with a suite of powerful software applications that include Avision Button Manager, AVScan , and PaperPort . With Button Manager, you can create searchable PDFs, scan and send images to e-mail, printer, or clouds servers such as Google DriveTM, or Evernote® with just a simple press of a button. The AVScan and PaperPort are highly effective image processing and document management software that helps you streamline your task more efficiently.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3>Features</h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Fast, 60ppm/120ipm scanning in color, grayscale and monochrome (200 dpi)</li>\n \t<li>Fast, 45ppm/90ipm scanning in color (300 dpi)</li>\n \t<li>Auto crop and deskew a document with the advanced Avision-developed image processing unit to enhance the scanning speed</li>\n \t<li>Support form paper up to 8.5 x 14 in.</li>\n \t<li>Daily duty cycle up to 10,000 sheets</li>\n \t<li>Robust 100-page automatic document feeder (80 g/m2, 20 lb)</li>\n \t<li>Reverse roller technology delivers outstanding feeding reliability</li>\n \t<li>Hard and embossed card scanning up to 1.25 mm in thickness in portrait or landscape feeding</li>\n \t<li>Press and scan to cloud servers via the bundled software Button Manager V2</li>\n \t<li>Earth-friendly LED technology</li>\n \t<li>Long page scanning:  1500 mm (59”) (600 dpi,color) / 5540 mm (218”) (200 dpi,color)</li>\n \t<li>hardware JPEG Compression, Compression TIFF (JPEG(7), CCITT G4, LZW), Compression PDF</li>\n \t<li>Auto power off setting</li>\n</ul>",

Scan size accepts paper from receipts 50 x 50 mm (2 x 2 in.) to business document 242 x 356 mm (9.5 x 14 in.). The auto document feeder is also robust enough to feed paper up to 413 g/m2 (110 lbs) and embossed hard cards such as ID cards, credit cards, driver’s license, and health insurance card up to 1.25 mm thick.\n<h3>Automatic multiple images cropping</h3>\nIn addition, the scanner comes with the convenient feature of multiple images cropping. With this feature, various sizes of documents such as photos, ID Cards, or business cards can be placed on the flatbed and the scanner is able to crop and create multiple images according to the original sizes of the documents in one single scan.\n<h3>Earth-Friendly LED Technology</h3>\nThe AD345F delivers high throughput and outstanding performance. However, it is earth-friendly at the same time. The LED technology requires no warm up time and is lower power consumption without generating mercury vapor as other traditional scanners using the CCFL (cold cathode fluorescent lamp) technology.\n<h3>High-Volume Daily Duty Cycle</h3>\nThe scanner can be used to scan up to 10,000 pages per day through the 100-page automatic document feeder.

    "description": "<h3>Support form document up to 242 x 356 mm (9.5 x 14 in.)</h3>\nThe AD345GF series boasts a unique and innovative design in comparison with its predecessors – the ability to accommodate form document up to 242 x 356 mm (9.5 x 14 in.). The extended document width from standard 216 mm (8.5 in.) to 242 mm (9.5 in.) makes the AD345GF series more competitive to fit for a wider range of documents.\n<h3>Reverse Roller Enhances Feeding Reliability</h3>\nDesigned with the innovative reverse roller for advanced paper separation capability, the AD345GF series delivers outstanding feeding reliability and operating productivity by effectively reducing the risk of a multi-feed or paper jam.\n<h3>Paper Protection Technology</h3>\nThe advanced Paper protection technology protects valuable paper from being wrinkled or torn by halting the scan process once a skewed page is detected.\n<h3>A Duplex Scanner Suited for Document and Cards</h3>\nThanks to the advanced straight paper path and image processing technology, mixed batches of documents with varies sizes and weights can be scanned, appropriately cropped, deskewed, and ready to use. Scan size accepts paper from receipts 50 x 50 mm (2 x 2 in.) to business document 242 x 356 mm (9.5 x 14 in.). The auto document feeder is also robust enough to feed paper up to 413 g/m2 (110 lbs) and embossed hard cards such as ID cards, credit cards, driver’s license, and health insurance card up to 1.25 mm thick.\n<h3>Automatic multiple images cropping</h3>\nIn addition, the scanner comes with the convenient feature of multiple images cropping. With this feature, various sizes of documents such as photos, ID Cards, or business cards can be placed on the flatbed and the scanner is able to crop and create multiple images according to the original sizes of the documents in one single scan.\n<h3>Earth-Friendly LED Technology</h3>\nThe AD345FGF delivers high throughput and outstanding performance. However, it is earth-friendly at the same time. The LED technology requires no warm up time and is lower power consumption without generating mercury vapor as other traditional scanners using the CCFL (cold cathode fluorescent lamp) technology.\n<h3>High-Volume Daily Duty Cycle</h3>\nThe scanner can be used to scan up to 10,000 pages per day through the 100-page automatic document feeder. The data indicates that this scanner is designed to scan document in any application requiring frequent document and hard card scanning.\n<h3>Powerful bundled software applications</h3>\nThe AD345GF series come with TWAIN and ISIS drivers, and are bundled with a suite of powerful software applications that include Avision Button Manager , AVScan , and PaperPort . With Button Manager , you can scan to searchable PDF, JPEG, BMP, or GIF file format, save to folder on your computer, and scan to e-mail, image editing application, or even a cloud application such as Google Drive, or Microsoft SharePoint with a press of a button. The AVScan and PaperPort are highly effective image processing and document management software that helps you streamline your task more efficiently.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3>Features</h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Fast, 60 ppm / 120 ipm scanning in color( 200 dpi ), grayscale and monochrome (200/300 dpi)</li>\n \t<li>Fast, 45 ppm / 90 ipm scanning in color( 300 dpi )</li>\n \t<li>Auto crop and deskew a document with the advanced Avision-developed image processing unit to enhance the scanning speed</li>\n \t<li>100-page auto document feeder (80 g/m2)</li>\n \t<li>Reverse roller technology delivers outstanding feeding reliability</li>\n \t<li>USB 3.1 Gen1 for high speed transmission</li>\n \t<li>Ultrasonic multi-feed detection</li>\n \t<li>Earth-friendly LED technology</li>\n \t<li>Easy-to-use button scanning</li>\n \t<li>Supports 236” (6000 mm, 200 dpi, color duplex ) long page scanning</li>\n \t<li>Auto power off setting</li>\n</ul>",

Scan size accepts paper from receipts 50 x 50 mm (2 x 2 in.) to business document 242 x 356 mm (9.5 x 14 in.). The auto document feeder is also robust enough to feed paper up to 413 g/m2 (110 lbs) and embossed hard cards such as ID cards, credit cards, driver’s license, and health insurance card up to 1.25 mm thick.\n<h3>Automatic multiple images cropping</h3>\nIn addition, the scanner comes with the convenient feature of multiple images cropping. With this feature, various sizes of documents such as photos, ID Cards, or business cards can be placed on the flatbed and the scanner is able to crop and create multiple images according to the original sizes of the documents in one single scan.\n<h3>Earth-Friendly LED Technology</h3>\nThe AD370F delivers high throughput and outstanding performance. However, it is earth-friendly at the same time. The LED technology requires no warm up time and is lower power consumption without generating mercury vapor as other traditional scanners using the CCFL (cold cathode fluorescent lamp) technology.\n<h3>High-Volume Daily Duty Cycle</h3>\nThe scanner can be used to scan up to 10,000 pages per day through the 100-page automatic document feeder. The data indicates that this scanner is designed to scan document in any application requiring frequent document and hard card scanning.\n<h3>Powerful bundled software applications</h3>\nThe AD370F come with TWAIN and ISIS drivers, and are bundled with a suite of powerful software applications that include Avision Button Manager , AVScan , and PaperPort . With Button Manager , you can scan to searchable PDF, JPEG, BMP, or GIF file format, save to folder on your computer, and scan to e-mail, image editing application, or even a cloud application such as Google Drive, or Microsoft SharePoint with a press of a button.

    "description": "<h3>High-Volume Daily Duty Cycle</h3>\nThe scanner can be used to scan up to 20,000 pages per day through the 150-page automatic document feeder. The data indicates that this scanner is designed to scan document in any application requiring frequent document and hard card scanning.\n<h3>Dual-lamp Design to Handle Wrinkled Documents</h3>\nDesigned to handle even extreme applications, the AD6090N scanner is built-in with two long-lasting lamps. These mercury-free lamps give you maximum illumination to help eliminate shadows from wrinkled documents.\n<h3>Paper Protection Mechanism</h3>\nThe innovative hardware design to implement various jam sensors on the paper path greatly improves the sensitivity to detect paper jams, which reduces the risk of damaging the document by stopping your scan job.\n\nPlus, the multi-feed detection technology helps detecting overlapping documents that go through the auto document feeder by either detecting extra paper length or paper thickness through triple ultrasonic sensors.\n<h3>Plastic card or ID card uses the straight paper path</h3>\nTo provide scanner users with the most versatile scanning environments, the user has the choice to utilize a “U-Turn or Straight Paper Path”.  By opening the rear cover, users can use the straight path to transport paper direct to the rear of the unit. To utilize the straight paper path ensures high reliability with plastic card, ID card, thick, long paper, or more fragile documents.\n<h3>Paper Protection Technology</h3>\nThe advanced Paper protection technology protects valuable paper from being wrinkled or torn by halting the scan process once a skewed page is detected.\n<h3>A Large LCD Display</h3>\nThe AD6090N is easy to use through the clear 1.8” LCD display. By selecting your destination and pressing the “Scan” button, the scan can be done and the scanned image can be sent to your specified destination application such as e-mail, printer, or your favorable image-editing software application. Up to nine frequently used scan settings and destinations can be preset for different scanning needs.\n<h3>Scan to Cloud with Button Manager V2</h3>\nThe AD6090N come with TWAIN and ISIS drivers, and are bundled with a suite of powerful software applications that include Avision Button Manager, AVScan , and PaperPort . With Button Manager , you can complete a scan and send the image directly to cloud servers such as Google Drive, Dropbox, Evernote, FaceBook, or Microsoft SharePoint with a press of a button. You can also save the image to searchable PDF, JPEG, BMP, or GIF file format, and scan to e-mail, or image editing application. In addition, the bundled software applications also include AVScan  and PaperPort which are are highly effective document management software to streamline your task more efficiently.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3>Features</h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Fast, 90 ppm / 180 ipm scanning in color, grayscale and monochrome  ( 300 dpi )</li>\n \t<li>Support form document up to 297 x 432 mm (A3)</li>\n \t<li>Robust 150-page (80 g/m²) automatic document feeder</li>\n \t<li>Daily duty cycle of up to 20,000 sheets</li>\n \t<li>Ultrasonic sensor to enable or disable detection in different areas of document</li>\n \t<li>Curved or Straight Paper Path</li>\n \t<li>Auto crop and deskew a document with the advanced image processing unit  to enhance the scanning speed</li>\n \t<li> Latest USB3.2 Gen1x1 connectivity for faster transmission speed</li>\n \t<li>Reverse roller technology delivers outstanding feeding reliability</li>\n \t<li>Hard and embossed card scanning up to 1.25 mm in thickness in landscape  feeding</li>\n \t<li>Press and scan to cloud servers via the bundled software Button Manager</li>\n \t<li>Earth-friendly LED technology</li>\n \t<li>Long page scanning up to 6000 mm (236”)</li>\n \t<li>Auto power off setting</li>\n</ul>",

    "description": "<h3>High-Volume Daily Duty Cycle</h3>\nThe scanner can be used to scan up to 100,000 pages per day through the 500-page (80 g/m²) automatic document feeder. The data indicates that this scanner is designed to scan document in any application requiring frequent document and hard card scanning.\n<h3>Dual CIS Design to Handle Wrinkled Documents</h3>\nDesigned to handle even extreme applications, the AD8120U scanner is built-in with two CIS. These CIS give you maximum illumination to help eliminate shadows from wrinkled documents.\n<h3>Triple Ultrasonic Sensors to Detect Overlapped Paper</h3>\nThree ultrasonic sensors provide protection against double feeds by detecting and preventing overlapping pages from being fed into the scanner at the same time. Each sensor can be set to ignore or detect specified areas of a document to accommodate pages with labels or attachments.\n<h3>Staple Detection Technology</h3>\nAvision’s Staple Detection feature automatically stops the scanning process when an unremoved staple is detected. If left undetected, staples could cause errors that compromise the document, cause jams, or damage the device.\n<h3>Plastic card or ID card uses the straight paper path</h3>\nTo provide scanner users with the most versatile scanning environments, the user has the choice to utilize a “Curved or Straight Paper Path”.  By opening the rear cover, users can use the straight path to transport paper to the rear of the unit. To utilize the straight paper path ensures high reliability with plastic card, ID card, thick, long paper, or more fragile documents.\n<h3>A Large LCD Display</h3>\nThe AD8120U is easy to use through the clear 1.8” LCD display. By selecting your destination and pressing the “Scan” button, the scan can be done and the scanned image can be sent to your specified destination application such as e-mail, printer, or your favorable image-editing software application. Up to nine frequently used scan settings and destinations can be preset for different scanning needs.\n<h3>Scan to Cloud with Button Manager</h3>\nThe AD8120U come with TWAIN and ISIS drivers, and are bundled with a suite of powerful software applications that include Avision Button Manager , AVScan , and PaperPort . With Button Manager , you can complete a scan and send the image directly to cloud servers such as Google Drive, Dropbox, Evernote, FaceBook, or Microsoft SharePoint with a press of a button. You can also save the image to searchable PDF, JPEG, BMP, or GIF file format, and scan to e-mail, or image editing application. In addition, the bundled software applications also include AVScan  and PaperPort which are are highly effective document management software to streamline your task more efficiently.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3>Features</h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Fast, 120 ppm / 240 ipm scanning in color, grayscale and monochrome  ( 300 dpi )</li>\n \t<li>Support form document up to 297 x 432 mm (A3)</li>\n \t<li>Robust 500-page (80 g/m²) automatic document feeder</li>\n \t<li>Daily duty cycle of up to 100,000 sheets</li>\n \t<li>Three Ultrasonic sensors to enable or disable detection in different areas of  document</li>\n \t<li>Staple detection feature</li>\n \t<li>Curved or Straight Paper Path</li>\n \t<li>Auto crop and deskew a document with the advanced image processing unit  to enhance the scanning speed</li>\n \t<li>Latest USB 3.2 Gen1x1 connectivity for faster transmission speed</li>\n \t<li>Reverse roller technology delivers outstanding feeding reliability</li>\n \t<li>Hard and embossed card scanning up to 1.25 mm in thickness in landscape  feeding</li>\n \t<li>Press and scan to cloud servers via the bundled software Button Manager</li>\n \t<li>Earth-friendly LED technology</li>\n \t<li>Long page scanning up to 6096 mm (240”)</li>\n \t<li>Auto power off setting</li>\n</ul>",

By assigning your frequently used settings and scan to destinations as Shortcuts, the AN335WL allows you to streamline your workflow and complete your scanning task in one step. Configuration and management of the scanner can also be performed via the LCD touch screen.\n<h3>Mobile scanning via Wi-Fi connection</h3>\nWith a Wi-Fi dongle, the AN335WL can work as a wireless device to scan and receive images directly from your mobile devices through Avision’s App.\n<h3>Convenient walk-up scanning</h3>\nA USB direct interface is available for scanning files to your USB flash memory drive.\n<h3>A Duplex Scanner Suited for Document and Cards</h3>\nThanks to the advanced straight paper path and image processing technology, mixed batches of documents with varies sizes and weights can be scanned, appropriately cropped, deskewed, and ready to use. Scan size accepts paper from receipts (74 x 50 mm/2.9” x 2”) to business document (216 x 356 mm/8.5 x 14 in.). The auto document feeder is also robust enough to feed paper from 27 to 413 g/m2 (7~110 lbs) and embossed hard cards such as ID cards, credit cards, driver’s license, and health insurance card up to 1.25mm in thickness.\n<h3>Friction Roller Enhances Feeding Reliability</h3>\nDesigned with the innovative friction roller for advanced paper separation capability, the AN335L deliver outstanding feeding reliability and operating productivity by effectively reducing the risk of a multi-feed or paper jam.\n<h3>Ultrasonic Multi-Feed Detection</h3>\nWith the ultrasonic multi-feed detection capability, the scanner allows you to set overlapped paper by detecting paper thickness between documents. The ultrasonic function can be turned off when scanning document with labels, sticky notes, or taped receipts. This innovative design prevents double feeding and effectively scans documents of different weights or thickness.\n<h3>Powerful Bundled Software Applications</h3>\nThe AN335WL come with TWAIN and ISIS drivers, and are bundled with a suite of powerful software applications that include Avision Button Manager, AVScan , and PaperPort . With Button Manager, you can create searchable PDFs, scan and send images to e-mail, printer, or clouds servers such as Google DriveTM, or Evernote® with just a simple press of a button. The AVScan and PaperPort are highly effective image processing and document management software that helps you streamline your task more efficiently.\n<h3></h3>\n<h3>Features</h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Fast, 40ppm /80 ipm scanning in color, grayscale and monochrome</li>\n \t<li>Scanning and sending images to e-mail, a shared folder (SMB), a FTP folder, cloud servers (Google Drive, Dropbox, Evernote), a USB flash drive, and the product’s memory</li>\n \t<li>Support form paper up to 216 x 356 mm (8.5 x 14 in.)</li>\n \t<li>Offer preview feature to view your image result before distributing</li>\n \t<li>Daily duty cycle up to 4,000 sheets</li>\n \t<li>Robust 50-page automatic document feeder (75 g/m2, 20 lb)</li>\n \t<li>Auto crop and deskew a document with the advanced image processing unit to enhance the scanning speed</li>\n \t<li>Friction roller technology delivers outstanding feeding reliability</li>\n \t<li>Hard and embossed card scanning up to 1.25 mm in thickness in portrait or landscape feeding</li>\n \t<li>Press and scan to cloud servers via the bundled software Button Manager</li>\n \t<li>Earth-friendly LED technology</li>\n \t<li>Long page scanning: &lt;240” (200 dpi)/&lt;218” (300 dpi)/&lt;59” (600 dpi)</li>\n \t<li>Auto power off setting</li>\n</ul>",

    "description": "<h3>Productive and Flexible</h3>\nThe AD225WN is productive at scan rate of up to 25 ppm and 50 ipm through the built-in 25-page auto document feeder and accommodate document up to 14”. To capture high quality card image, the AD225WN also includes special front and rear tray to handle plastic ID cards, driver licenses, and even embossed cards up to 1.25 mm or paper up to legal size (8.5 x 14 in.) and weight between 27 and 413 g/m2 (rear tray: 50~105 g/m2).\n<h3>Effective network Scanning</h3>\nWith the network port at the back side, the AD225WN allows you to use it as a network scanner.  This means users in the intranet environment can share the scanner and obtain the scanned image from their individual computer.\n<h3>Two Eject Paths</h3>\nIf your single-page document is loaded from the front or rear feeder, the scanner provides two eject paths. Document can be ejected to the opposite side or to the same side of the feeder. Switch between these paths on the TWAIN user interface and select an eject path according to your need.\n\n*Plastic card only available for front tray feeding.\n<h3>Easy to scan with a press of a button</h3>\nWith Avision’s newly developed software application- Button Manager , the AD225WN scans both sides of a page directly to PDF, searchable PDF, JPEG, or to office applications like Word or Excel® with a press of a button. The AD225WN  automatically recognizes the size of each document, detect and straighten for skew, and show images in their proper orientation. Plus, the scanned image can be sent directly to your specified destination including e-mail, printer, image editing software application, or even a cloud server such as Google Drive or Microsoft SharePoint.\n<h3>What we have bundled</h3>\nThe Avision AD225WN comes with TWAIN and ISIS drivers, and is bundled with a suite of powerful software applications that include Avision Button Manager , AVScan , and PaperPort . With Button Manager , you can create searchable PDFs, scan and send images to e-mail, printer, or other destinations with a simple press of the Scan button.

With a generous Automatic Document Feeder capacity of 500 sheets and 120ppm speed, it will handle continuous scanning of large volumes of documents.\n\nConsistent performance is ensured by high-speed USB 3.2 or Gigabit LAN connectivity, and the fact that its wide 105° opening angle and internal LED lights make it easy to maintain.\n\nStoppages are avoided thanks to state-of-the-art paper protection features such as Stapled Document Detection, and the Intelligent Multi-Feed function, which understands when to stop for labels, sticky notes or photos, and when not to.\n\nMany different types of documents can be handled without fuss or interruption because of its two feed paths; the classic U-turn ADF, and the straight-through path which accepts documents up to 1.25mm thick. And mixed batches are no problem thanks to the Automatic Profile Selection feature.\n\nRICOH Image Scanners deliver industry-leading OCR accuracy rates and exceptional image quality. This is achieved through a combination of our unique Clear Image Capture technology, and PaperStream IP driver which also removes noise and optimises file size for lower-cost storage.\n\nThe RICOH fi-8820 offers a complete package for high volume scanning. The hardware comes with its own PaperStream software, but can be flexibly deployed with any other capture application. It has also been optimised for use with industry-leading PaperStream Capture Pro software. Tiered service plans and fixed-cost consumables and replacement parts offer predictable running costs.

This means users in the intranet environment can share the scanner and obtain the scanned image from their individual computer. What is best, the network scanner allows you to switch to other computers in the LAN, users in the LAN can really enjoy the scan and collect the image from their own computers!\n<h3>▍Mobile scanning via Wi-Fi connection</h3>\nBuilt-in with a Wi-Fi dongle, the AD3100FWN can work as a wireless device to scan and receive images directly from your mobile devices through Avision’s App.\n<h3>▍Support form document up to 242 x 356 mm (9.5 x 14 in.)</h3>\nThe AD3100FWN boast unique and innovative design in comparison with its predecessors – the ability to accommodate form document up to 242 x 356 mm (9.5 x 14 in.). The extended document width from standard 216 mm (8.5 in.) to 242 mm (9.5 in.) makes the AD3100FWN more competitive to fit for a wider range of documents.\n<h3>▍Reverse Roller Enhances Feeding Reliability</h3>\nDesigned with the innovative reverse roller for advanced paper separation capability, the AD380F Series delivers outstanding feeding reliability and operating productivity by effectively reducing the risk of a multi-feed or paper jam.\n<h3>▍Paper Protection Technology</h3>\nThe advanced Paper protection technology protects valuable paper from being wrinkled or torn by halting the scan process once a skewed page is detected.\n<h3>▍A Duplex Scanner Suited for Document and Cards</h3>\nThanks to the advanced straight paper path and image processing technology, mixed batches of documents with varies sizes and weights can be scanned, appropriately cropped, deskewed, and ready to use. Scan size accepts paper from receipts 50 x 50 mm (2 x 2 in.) to business document 242 x 356 mm (9.5 x 14 in.). The auto document feeder is also robust enough to feed paper up to 400 g/m2 (110 lbs) and embossed hard cards such as ID cards, credit cards, driver’s license, and health insurance card up to 1.25 mm thick.\n<h3>▍Automatic multiple images cropping</h3>\nIn addition, the scanner comes with the convenient feature of multiple images cropping. With this feature, various sizes of documents such as photos, ID Cards, or business cards can be placed on the flatbed and the scanner is able to crop and create multiple images according to the original sizes of the documents in one single scan.\n<h3>▍Earth-Friendly LED Technology</h3>\nThe AD3100FWN deliver high throughput and outstanding performance. However, it is earth-friendly at the same time. The LED technology requires no warm up time and is lower power consumption without generating mercury vapor as other traditional scanners using the CCFL (cold cathode fluorescent lamp) technology.\n<h3>▍High-Volume Daily Duty Cycle</h3>\nThe scanner can be used to scan up to 15,000 pages per day through the 100-page automatic document feeder.

This means users in the intranet environment can share the scanner and obtain the scanned image from their individual computer. What is best, the network scanner allows you to switch to other computers in the LAN, users in the LAN can really enjoy the scan and collect the image from their own computers!\n<h3>▍Support form document up to 242 x 356 mm (9.5 x 14 in.)</h3>\nThe AD3100FN boast unique and innovative design in comparison with its predecessors – the ability to accommodate form document up to 242 x 356 mm (9.5 x 14 in.). The extended document width from standard 216 mm (8.5 in.) to 242 mm (9.5 in.) makes the AD3100FN Series more competitive to fit for a wider range of documents.\n<h3>▍Reverse Roller Enhances Feeding Reliability</h3>\nDesigned with the innovative reverse roller for advanced paper separation capability, the AD380F Series delivers outstanding feeding reliability and operating productivity by effectively reducing the risk of a multi-feed or paper jam.\n<h3>▍Paper Protection Technology</h3>\nThe advanced Paper protection technology protects valuable paper from being wrinkled or torn by halting the scan process once a skewed page is detected.\n<h3>▍A Duplex Scanner Suited for Document and Cards</h3>\nThanks to the advanced straight paper path and image processing technology, mixed batches of documents with varies sizes and weights can be scanned, appropriately cropped, deskewed, and ready to use. Scan size accepts paper from receipts 50 x 50 mm (2 x 2 in.) to business document 242 x 356 mm (9.5 x 14 in.). The auto document feeder is also robust enough to feed paper up to 400 g/m2 (110 lbs) and embossed hard cards such as ID cards, credit cards, driver’s license, and health insurance card up to 1.25 mm thick.\n<h3>▍Automatic multiple images cropping</h3>\nIn addition, the scanner comes with the convenient feature of multiple images cropping. With this feature, various sizes of documents such as photos, ID Cards, or business cards can be placed on the flatbed and the scanner is able to crop and create multiple images according to the original sizes of the documents in one single scan.\n<h3>▍Earth-Friendly LED Technology</h3>\nThe AD3100FN deliver high throughput and outstanding performance. However, it is earth-friendly at the same time. The LED technology requires no warm up time and is lower power consumption without generating mercury vapor as other traditional scanners using the CCFL (cold cathode fluorescent lamp) technology.\n<h3>▍High-Volume Daily Duty Cycle</h3>\nThe scanner can be used to scan up to 15,000 pages per day through the 100-page automatic document feeder. The data indicates that this scanner is designed to scan document in any application requiring frequent document and hard card scanning.\n<h3>▍Powerful bundled software applications</h3>\nThe AD3100FN come with TWAIN and ISIS drivers, and are bundled with a suite of powerful software applications that include Avision Button Manager , AVScan , and PaperPort . With Button Manager , you can scan to searchable PDF, JPEG, BMP, or GIF file format, save to folder on your computer, and scan to e-mail, image editing application, or even a cloud application such as Google Drive, or Microsoft SharePoint with a press of a button.

The data indicates that this scanner is designed to scan document in any application requiring frequent document and hard card scanning.\n<h3>▍Dual CIS Design to Handle Wrinkled Documents</h3>\nDesigned to handle even extreme applications, the AD8130U scanner is built-in with two CIS. These CIS give you maximum illumination to help eliminate shadows from wrinkled documents.\n<h3>▍Triple Ultrasonic Sensors to Detect Overlapped Paper</h3>\nThree ultrasonic sensors provide protection against double feeds by detecting and preventing overlapping pages from being fed into the scanner at the same time. Each sensor can be set to ignore or detect specified areas of a document to accommodate pages with labels or attachments.\n<h3>▍Staple Detection Technology</h3>\nAvision’s Staple Detection feature automatically stops the scanning process when an unremoved staple is detected. If left undetected, staples could cause errors that compromise the document, cause jams, or damage the device.\n<h3>▍Plastic card or ID card uses the straight paper path</h3>\nTo provide scanner users with the most versatile scanning environments, the user has the choice to utilize a “Curved or Straight Paper Path”.  By opening the rear cover, users can use the straight path to transport paper to the rear of the unit. To utilize the straight paper path ensures high reliability with plastic card, ID card, thick, long paper, or more fragile documents.\n<h3>▍A Large LCD Display</h3>\nThe AD8130U is easy to use through the clear 1.8” LCD display. By selecting your destination and pressing the “Scan” button, the scan can be done and the scanned image can be sent to your specified destination application such as e-mail, printer, or your favorable image-editing software application. Up to nine frequently used scan settings and destinations can be preset for different scanning needs.\n<h3>▍Scan to Cloud with Button Manager</h3>\nThe AD8130U come with TWAIN and ISIS drivers, and are bundled with a suite of powerful software applications that include Avision Button Manager , AVScan , and PaperPort . With Button Manager , you can complete a scan and send the image directly to cloud servers such as Google Drive, Dropbox, Evernote, FaceBook, or Microsoft SharePoint with a press of a button. You can also save the image to searchable PDF, JPEG, BMP, or GIF file format, and scan to e-mail, or image editing application. In addition, the bundled software applications also include AVScan  and PaperPort which are are highly effective document management software to streamline your task more efficiently.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3>▍Features</h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Fast, 130 ppm / 260 ipm scanning in color, grayscale and monochrome  ( 200 / 300 dpi )</li>\n \t<li>Support form document up to 297 x 432 mm (A3)</li>\n \t<li>Robust 600-page  automatic document feeder</li>\n \t<li>Daily duty cycle of up to 100,000 sheets</li>\n \t<li>Three Ultrasonic sensors to enable or disable detection in different areas of  document</li>\n \t<li>Staple detection feature</li>\n \t<li>Curved or Straight Paper Path</li>\n \t<li>Auto crop and deskew a document with the advanced image processing unit  to enhance the scanning speed</li>\n \t<li>Latest USB 3.2 Gen1x1 connectivity for faster transmission speed</li>\n \t<li>Reverse roller technology delivers outstanding feeding reliability</li>\n \t<li>Hard and embossed card scanning up to 1.25 mm in thickness in landscape  feeding</li>\n \t<li>Press and scan to cloud servers via the bundled software Button Manager</li>\n \t<li>Earth-friendly LED technology</li>\n \t<li>Long page scanning up to 6096 mm (240”)</li>\n \t<li>Auto power off setting</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3></h3>\n<h3><strong>▎Certification mark</strong></h3>\n<div>\n<table id=\"tbl\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td bgcolor=\"white\" width=\"200px\"><span class=\"su-lightbox\" data-mfp-src=\"#my-custom-popup\" data-mfp-type=\"inline\" data-mobile=\"yes\"><img class=\"wp-image-7528 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.avision.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/800px-Energy_Star_logo.svg-293x300.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 73px) 100vw, 73px\" srcset=\"https://www.avision.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/800px-Energy_Star_logo.svg-293x300.png 293w, https://www.avision.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/800px-Energy_Star_logo.svg-768x786.png 768w, https://www.avision.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/800px-Energy_Star_logo.svg-600x614.png 600w, https://www.avision.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/800px-Energy_Star_logo.svg.png 800w\" alt=\"\" width=\"73\" height=\"75\" /></span></td>\n<td bgcolor=\"white\" width=\"200px\"><a class=\"no-lightbox\" href=\"https://www.avision.com/en/about-avision/why-avision/core-image-scanning-technology/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-14997 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.avision.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/twain.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"76\" height=\"80\" /></a></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>",

Each sensor can be set to ignore or detect specified areas of a document to accommodate pages with labels or attachments.\n<h3>▍Staple Detection Technology</h3>\nAvision’s Staple Detection feature automatically stops the scanning process when an unremoved staple is detected. If left undetected, staples could cause errors that compromise the document, cause jams, or damage the device.\n<h3>▍Plastic card or ID card uses the straight paper path</h3>\nTo provide scanner users with the most versatile scanning environments, the user has the choice to utilize a “Curved or Straight Paper Path”.  By opening the rear cover, users can use the straight path to transport paper to the rear of the unit. To utilize the straight paper path ensures high reliability with plastic card, ID card, thick, long paper, or more fragile documents.\n<h3>▍A Document Scanner with an Imprinter</h3>\nThe AD8130zP scanner can be integrated with an imprinter.  The innovative combination allows users to print a sequence number or characters physically on the front side of each page that is being scanned. By printing serial numbers, the scanned data can be tracked, matched and/or indexed with the original document.\n<h3>▍A Large LCD Display</h3>\nThe AD8130zP is easy to use through the clear 1.8” LCD display. By selecting your destination and pressing the “Scan” button, the scan can be done and the scanned image can be sent to your specified destination application such as e-mail, printer, or your favorable image-editing software application. Up to nine frequently used scan settings and destinations can be preset for different scanning needs.\n<h3>▍Scan to Cloud with Button Manager</h3>\nThe AD8130zP come with TWAIN and ISIS drivers, and are bundled with a suite of powerful software applications that include Avision Button Manager , AVScan , and PaperPort . With Button Manager , you can complete a scan and send the image directly to cloud servers such as Google Drive, Dropbox, Evernote, FaceBook, or Microsoft SharePoint with a press of a button. You can also save the image to searchable PDF, JPEG, BMP, or GIF file format, and scan to e-mail, or image editing application. In addition, the bundled software applications also include AVScan  and PaperPort which are are highly effective document management software to streamline your task more efficiently.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3>▍Features</h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Fast, 130 ppm / 260 ipm scanning in color, grayscale and monochrome ( 300dpi )</li>\n \t<li>Fast, 150 ppm / 300 ipm scanning in color, grayscale and monochrome ( 200dpi )</li>\n \t<li>Support form document up to 297 x 432 mm (A3)</li>\n \t<li>Robust 600-page  automatic document feeder</li>\n \t<li>Daily duty cycle of up to 100,000 sheets</li>\n \t<li>Three Ultrasonic sensors to enable or disable detection in different areas of  document</li>\n \t<li>Staple detection feature</li>\n \t<li>Curved or Straight Paper Path</li>\n \t<li>Auto crop and deskew a document with the advanced image processing unit  to enhance the scanning speed</li>\n \t<li>Latest USB 3.2 Gen1 connectivity for faster transmission speed</li>\n \t<li>Reverse roller technology delivers outstanding feeding reliability</li>\n \t<li>Hard and embossed card scanning up to 1.25 mm in thickness in landscape  feeding</li>\n \t<li>Press and scan to cloud servers via the bundled software Button Manager</li>\n \t<li>Earth-friendly LED technology</li>\n \t<li>Long page scanning up to 6096 mm (240”)</li>\n \t<li>Auto power off setting</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3></h3>\n<h3><strong>▎Certification mark</strong></h3>\n<div>\n<table id=\"tbl\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td bgcolor=\"white\" width=\"200px\"><span class=\"su-lightbox\" data-mfp-src=\"#my-custom-popup\" data-mfp-type=\"inline\" data-mobile=\"yes\"><img class=\"wp-image-7528 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.avision.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/800px-Energy_Star_logo.svg-293x300.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 73px) 100vw, 73px\" srcset=\"https://www.avision.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/800px-Energy_Star_logo.svg-293x300.png 293w, https://www.avision.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/800px-Energy_Star_logo.svg-768x786.png 768w, https://www.avision.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/800px-Energy_Star_logo.svg-600x614.png 600w, https://www.avision.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/800px-Energy_Star_logo.svg.png 800w\" alt=\"\" width=\"73\" height=\"75\" /></span></td>\n<td bgcolor=\"white\" width=\"200px\"><a class=\"no-lightbox\" href=\"https://www.avision.com/en/about-avision/why-avision/core-image-scanning-technology/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-14997 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.avision.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/twain.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"76\" height=\"80\" /></a></td>\n<td bgcolor=\"white\" width=\"200px\"><a class=\"no-lightbox\" href=\"https://scadmin.kofax.com/KCSearch/Search.aspx\"><img class=\" wp-image-7828 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.avision.com/tw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/09/VRSready_256.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"70\" height=\"70\" /></a></td>\n<td bgcolor=\"white\" width=\"200px\"><img class=\" wp-image-7828 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.avision.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/EMC_CloudCapture.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"70\" height=\"70\" /></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>",

The data indicates that this scanner is designed to scan documents in any application requiring frequent document and hard card scanning.\n<h3>▍Triple Ultrasonic Sensors to Detect Overlapped Paper</h3>\nThree ultrasonic sensors provide protection against double feeds by detecting and preventing overlapping pages from being fed into the scanner at the same time. Each sensor can be set to ignore or detect specified areas of a document to accommodate pages with labels or attachments.\n<h3>▍Plastic card or ID card uses the straight paper path</h3>\nTo provide scanner users with the most versatile scanning environments, the user has the choice to utilize a “Curved or Straight Paper Path”.  By opening the rear cover, users can use the straight path to transport paper to the rear of the unit. To utilize the straight paper path ensures high reliability with plastic card, ID card, thick, long paper, or more fragile documents.\n<h3>▍Dual-lamp Design to Handle Wrinkled Documents</h3>\nDesigned to handle even extreme applications, the AD8150 scanner is built-in with two long-lasting lamps. These mercury-free lamps give you maximum illumination to help eliminate shadows from wrinkled documents.\n<h3>▍Staple Detection Technology</h3>\nAvision’s Staple Detection feature automatically stops the scanning process when an unremoved staple is detected. If left undetected, staples could cause errors that compromise the document, cause jams, or damage the device.\n<h3>▍1.8″ LCD Display</h3>\nThe AD8150 is easy to use through the clear 1.8” LCD display. By selecting your destination and pressing the “Scan” button, the scan can be done and the scanned image can be sent to your specified destination application such as e-mail, printer, or your favorable image-editing software application. Up to nine frequently used scan settings and destinations can be preset for different scanning needs.\n<h3>▍Scan to Cloud with Button Manager</h3>\nThe AD8150 come with TWAIN and ISIS drivers, and are bundled with a suite of powerful software applications that include Avision Button Manager , AVScan , and PaperPort . With Button Manager , you can complete a scan and send the image directly to cloud servers such as Google Drive, Dropbox, Evernote, FaceBook, or Microsoft SharePoint with a press of a button.
